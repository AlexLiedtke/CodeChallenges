There are 7 holes in the ground, with a tunnel connecting them in a straight line under ground.
There is a mole in the tunnel, you know not where, and you are trying to catch it.
The mole is at rest, and always reachable under one of the openings.
You cannot see into the holes, so you must reach into a hole with your hand to know if that is where the mole is.
If the mole is in the hole you reach into, you catch it.
Reaching into any opening scares it though, so if you did not catch it then after you pull your hand back out of a hole it will always move to an adjacent hole.

Prove with 100% certainty why it either IS or IS NOT possible to catch the mole.
